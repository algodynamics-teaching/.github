> [!IMPORTANT]
> 10 Steps of algorithm design:
>  - $(I)$ What are the legal inputs for the program?
>  - $(A)$ What are all the possible outputs of the program?
>  - $(f)$ How exactly is the output of the program related to the input?
>  - (Resource Constraints) What are the resource constraints for the program in terms of the allowed types of variables, guards, and commands?
>  - $(X)$ What are all the variables that are needed for the program?
>  - $(\rho)$ How are the variables to be initialized?
>  - $(\pi)$ How is the output of the program to be read?
>  - $(F)$ How should the program change the values of the variables in one step?
>  - Does the program terminate for every legal input?
>  - If the program terminates for a legal input, is the output correct?
